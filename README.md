Secure file communication channel
  It is a simple and secure communication channel implemented in Python. It shows how data can be written and read securely between two processes or programs using file storage as a communication medium. Data is encrypted using AES encryption for added security.

Possibilities
Secure file storage: Data is stored securely using temporary files to prevent unauthorized access.
AES Encryption: Data is encrypted using AES encryption for added security.
Error handling: The code contains blocks that can handle possible errors well, apart from testing.
requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Cryptographic library

Run the main.py script to write the message to a secure file:
Python main.py
The script creates a secure file named safe_secret_channel.txt that contains the encrypted message.
Run the main.py script again to read the message from the secure file.
